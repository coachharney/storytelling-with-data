# Is "Small Ball" Smart for Ivy Women?

This repository contains an excel spreadsheet of the Cumulative Boxscores from each Ivy League Women's Basketball team from the seasons 2011-2012 through 2016-2017 using Synergy Sports Technology data.

The goal of this project is to use this dataset to determine if the "small ball" approach to basketball at the NBA level is statistically viable to be reproduced at the collegiate women's basketball Divisoin I level.

Areas worth investigating-- effective Field Goal %, minutes played, fouls for and against, etc.

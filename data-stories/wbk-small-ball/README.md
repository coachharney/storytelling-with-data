# Ivy League Women's Basketball Small Ball Dataset

This repository contains an excel spreadsheet of the Cumulative Boxscores from each Ivy League Women's Basketball team from the seasons 2011-2012 through 2016-2017 using Synergy Sports Technology data.

The goal of this project is to use this dataset to determine if the "small ball" approach to basketball at the NBA level is statistically viable to reproduce at the college women's basketball level.

Areas to investigate-- effective Field Goal %, minutes played, fouls for and against, etc.
